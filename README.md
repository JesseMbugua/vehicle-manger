Vehicle Management System
This project demonstrates the use of Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface in Java to model a simple vehicle management system. The system allows you to create a car object, start and stop it, and display its unique features.

📂 Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:

myvehicle.java: Contains the abstract class myvehicle that implements the vehicle interface.

vehicle.java: Contains the vehicle interface and the car class that extends the myvehicle abstract class.

app.java: Contains the App class with the main method to run the program.

🖥️ Expected Output
the Rolls-Royce Phantom car has started
The Rolls-Royce Phantom car has Starlight Headliner
the Rolls-Royce Phantom car has stopped
the cars model is: Rolls-Royce Phantom
the cars release date is: 2017
🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
Interface (vehicle):

Defines a contract for methods (start and stop) that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.

Abstract Class (myvehicle):

Provides a partial implementation of the vehicle interface.

Includes abstract methods (uniqueFeature) that must be implemented by subclasses.

Concrete Class (car):

Extends the abstract class myvehicle.

Provides concrete implementations for all abstract methods.

💡 About the Project
This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how to use interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes in Java to build a modular and extensible system. It serves as a great example for understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
