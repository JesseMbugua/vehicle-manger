# Vehicle Management System

## üöó Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Concrete Class**, **Abstract Class**, and **Interface** in Java to model a simple vehicle management system. The system allows you to create a car object, start and stop it, and display its unique features.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- **`myvehicle.java`**: Contains the abstract class `MyVehicle` that implements the `Vehicle` interface.
- **`vehicle.java`**: Contains the `Vehicle` interface and the `Car` class that extends the `MyVehicle` abstract class.
- **`app.java`**: Contains the `App` class with the `main` method to run the program.

## üñ•Ô∏è Expected Output

```bash
The Rolls-Royce Phantom car has started
The Rolls-Royce Phantom car has Starlight Headliner
The Rolls-Royce Phantom car has stopped
The car's model is: Rolls-Royce Phantom
The car's release date is: 2017

üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated
1. Interface (Vehicle)
Defines a contract for methods (start and stop) that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.
2. Abstract Class (MyVehicle)
Provides a partial implementation of the Vehicle interface.
Includes abstract methods (uniqueFeature) that must be implemented by subclasses.
3. Concrete Class (Car)
Extends the abstract class MyVehicle.
Provides concrete implementations for all abstract methods.
üí° About the Project
This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how to use interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes in Java to build a modular and extensible system. It serves as a great example for understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
